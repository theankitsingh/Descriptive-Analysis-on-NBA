# Descriptive-Analysis-on-NBA

Created descriptive models and some degree of predictive models based on the data set of NBA playerâ€™s stats available from 1980 to 2017 and analyse how the game has evolved
Performed the analysis using Correlation, Regression, One-way ANOVA, Summary tables and performed clustering to analyse new and unorthodox positions coaches use to maximize a single possession of ball game
Presented the results to help the general managers and coaching staff of teams understand how their acquisitions be rationalized based on descriptive analysis and how to utilize the skill set they possess in their arsenal
